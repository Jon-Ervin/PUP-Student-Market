# PUP Student Market

## Project Concept

### Statement of the Problem
Online buy and sell has become a trend nowadays because of its convenience of finding wanted items anywhere and anytime. Many buy and sell websites are already made but, they have a wide range of users, which makes it harder for identification of the buyer and seller.

Students these days use online market for buying educational items. Most of them do not have jobs yet and still depend on their guardian/s so they prefer to look for cheap items. Students are usually at a young age and are prone to being a victim of false transactions. 

### Proposed Solution
To build a trustworthy environment for students, the solution is to make an online market where the users are limited to students of a school. They can be identified with their information recorded in the school.

This project will make an online student market where students can buy, sell, and trade their items. It minimizes the risks of bogus/fraud buyers/sellers with our report system, where they can report or flag the people they did not have a good experience with. It will have a Purchase History feature where you can keep track of all your purchases. Transactions come with receipt that contains the 
details of your transaction. The receipt includes transaction code, name and student number of the buyer/seller, date and time of the transaction, negotiated price by both parties, and agreed meeting place. 

### Target Users
Polytechnic University of the Philippines Students

### Benefits
Centralized, organized, and secured easy-access online market that is open for all students in any branch of PUP. Reduction of miscommunication between the two parties involved in the transaction (buyer and seller).
